== Overview

API Sync View is a feature integrated in Anypoint Studio that allows you to seamlessly pull, push and compare your API definition between Anypoint Studio and link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/designing-your-api[API Designer].

== How to Show It

The API Sync View shows by default with Studio 6.0 and newer next to the Mule Palette:

If you choose to close this view, you can bring it back up by going to *Window*, *Show view*, and *Other*. +
Inside the *APIKit Views* Folder, you can find the *API Sync* view.

You can also find this view using the _Quick Access_ bar. Locate your quick access bar in the top right of your Studio window, next to your Perspectives, and type _API Sync_. The view should appear labeled as _Views_:

== Features

When you create a Mule application using an API definition from Anypoint Platform, API Sync holds that reference and compares its _local version_ (the one from Studio) with its _remote version_ (the one in Anypoint Platform).

There are 3 ways this process can go:

. *Both status are synced*: The API definition in Studio is the same than the one hosted in Anypoint Platform.
+
The view shows this API with a green back tip next to the API's name:

+
. *The local version is ahead of the remote version*: You've made changes to your local application and those changes should be pushed to Anypoint Platform.
+
API sync displays a black icon with an up arrow, indicating that the change needs to be updated with the platform:

+
. *The remote version is ahead of the local version*: The API is updated from Anypoint Platform and those updates should be downloaded to Studio before continue working.
+
API Sync shows a black icon with a down arrow, indicating that the change needs to be downloaded to Studio.

== Using API Sync View

Assume that you made a change to your API definition in Studio. API sync immediately indicates that there are local changes that need to be pushed to Anypoint Platform.

. The _Download_ button downloads the last updated version from Anypoint Platform to Anypoint Studio. In this case, since recent changes were made using Studio, downloading the old version overwrites all changes made locally.
. The _Upload_ button uploads the last updated version from Anypoint Studio to Anypoint Platform. In this case, the local updated version overwrites the old version in Anypoint Platform.
. the _Compare_ button displays the differences between the local file and the one in Anypoint Platform.

+
This view, compares the local version of the file with the remote version. You can use the buttons located in the top right corner for this view to navigate through each difference or change.
. The _Refresh_ button checks the status between your API definition in Studio and your API definition in Anypoint Platform. If there are changes in Anypoint Platform, it updates the local version.
. The _Connect to API manager_ button allows you to connect to the Anypoint Platform account of the owner of the API.
+
This feature is useful when having more than one user configured in your Anypoint Studio. +
If one user syncs one API, and then another user logs in using his/her Anypoint Platform credentials, the API synced first shows a `[Not Connected]` label next to its name, indicating that this API does not belong to the current user. +
By clicking the _Connect to API manager_ button, Studio prompts for your credentials. If they belong to the owner of the API, it connects to the selected resource.
